### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**This is Taomihog :hedgehog:**  

- :pig_nose: I am currently learning C/C++ and CUDA.  
- :dna: I just finished 2 programs ( a [CPU version](https://github.com/Taomihog/unzipDNA_CPU) and a [GPU version](https://github.com/Taomihog/unzipDNA_GPU)) to predict DNA mechanical unzipping curves (the force to separate the 2 strands of DNA).  
  1. [CPU version](https://github.com/Taomihog/unzipDNA_CPU): meta-programming + multi-threading. It is **>1000x faster** than the sequential program people usually use.   
  2. [GPU version](https://github.com/Taomihog/unzipDNA_GPU): CUDA + my "GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop", **10x faster than my CPU version**. Can finish the whole genome of *E.Coli* in a minute.  
- :yarn: I am working on a **trace alignment program** for unzipping data clustering. The ultimate goal is to create a highly-parallel single-molecule unzipping platform to identify the whole transcriptome (in forms of RNA:DNA hybrid) from their unzipping force-extension curves.
- :knot: I am currently learning knot theory and trying to create a faster Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the torque to braid 2 DNA molecules (C/C++).  
- :mailbox_with_mail: How to reach me: taomihog@gmail.com
