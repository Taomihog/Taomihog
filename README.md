### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**This is Taomihog :hedgehog:**  

- :pig_nose: I am currently learning C/C++/CUDA.  
- :knot: I am currently learning knot theory.  
- :dna: I just finished 2 programs ( a CPU version and a GPU version) to predict DNA mechanical unzipping curve (the force to separate the 2 strands of DNA).
- :dna: In [CPU version](https://github.com/Taomihog/unzipDNA_CPU), I meta-programmed constexpr arrays and multi-threaded the calculation on my 20-core CPU and speed up the calculation by >1000 times. However, to calculate a whole force-extension curve to unzip a DNA of ~4 kb still takes 0.2s. I want a even higher speed.
- :dna: Then I created a [GPU version](https://github.com/Taomihog/unzipDNA_GPU) to use my "GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop", and increaded the speed by another factor of 10. Now the program can finish the whole genome of *E.Coli* in a minute.

- :yarn: I am working on a program to calculate the torque to braid 2 DNA molecules (C/C++).
